:pushpin:	## Logline:
The trash is falling into the city, and you control the main character with various movements and tools to pick up all the garbage and sort them within the given time limit.
:pushpin:	## Story:
The City of Atlantis! It used to be a clean, modern, and beautiful city. But, as the main character (Mellann) looks and walks around, she finds that the city is filthy and filled with trash! Suddenly, something fell on her head and dropped to the floor. It is a plastic bottle. She looks up and disaster ensues as she sees all kinds of garbage falling from the sky. Fuming with rage, Mellann is going to make sure to clean up the mess and keep the city clean. And she needs your help.
## Gameplay:
Garbage Hunter is a platformer and educational game. The Player will use the keyboard and mouse as input devices, take all the means to collect and bring the trash to the bins, and sort the garbage between the different classifications. The game would be over if time runs out or if the player has not sorted enough trash.  The Player has to sort the trash correctly to score enough points to win and enter the next challenge. 

# Controls (Keyboard & Mouse):    
| Mouse movements         | Rotate view, Aim, Drag UI Elements |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|W, A, S, D               |  Move forward, backward, left, right|
|Space                    | Jump|
|Space                   | (During initial jump)| 
|Double                  | Jump|
|W,A,S,D with left Shift | Dash (fast move for a short distance)|
|E                        | Hookshot|
|E (While in Hookshot)   | Cancels hookshot|
|Space (While in Hookshot)| Launch yourself a short distance|

# Technology:
Moving fast and sorting for scores are the keys to winning this game. To move fast, the player can press E for Hookshot to traverse between buildings and walls, Left Shift to dash, double Space to double jump. When the trash bag is full (25 items), the player must go to designated garbage stations to sort the trash.  The player can then pick up new trash. Players will score points as the trash is sorted correctly. When the player scores enough points, they can enter the next level.
